I think that the hand and the beam of light might confuse the AI. The second image contains two tape measures.

But they are difficult because the images are distorted; and a select few contain distracting backgrounds.

They are difficult because the images are pixellated; making it harder to identify details other than a general outline and colors.

They would be difficult because of the effects that have been added to the images. This black-and-white process gets rid of a lot of the details on certain images; and sometimes completely erases part of the tool.

They would be difficult because they are only monochromatic outlines of the objects; and some have lost details in the process of converting to this format.

They would be difficult because the colors are not accurate to the type of tool; and some details have been lost in the images.

They would be difficult because of the blur effect applied to them; which causes a lot of detail to be lost.

Objects that are split into for different sections would be especially hard. some of the objects; like the wrenches; have there distinctive property (wrench head) completely in its own section; which would make it easier to identify.

The AI could determine that the grass on the outer edges is the focus of the image; and determine that the image is of grass.

One of the defining features of the shovel; for example; is its long straight handle. But in the image shown; the handle is now bent because of the distortion. And in the image of the axe; the handle is almost completely obstructed; ruining the defined silhouette of the handle.

The flashlight for example does not really have any defining features anymore besides its silhouette; which could be mistaken for something else.

The hand is featured the most in the flashlight photo; and the outline of the tool in the low-contrast photo is still very difficult to determine because there are so many other edges in the same image.

If you present an outline of something with a distinctive shape but with a major change done to it; it will be much more difficult to recognize what that shape is supposed to be.

The shovel for example has an arm reaching out to hold it; which makes the shovel look like an odd object with an extra handle coming off of the regular handle. Then one of the other pictures selected simply shows a hand and you cannot really tell from the silhouette what tool is supposed to be represented there.

On the other image; there is a background that does not contrast from the main object very much which would make it difficult to determine the edges of the object.

When blurred it looks mostly like just a hand. The other picture has the same problem of low contrast; made worse by the lower resolution.

There are a few images in which the object entirely blends in with the background because the tones in the object is almost identical to the background it is set in.

But with the small blurriness; I think it still would be able to esaily identify the tool. Some pictures of the tools have a difficult bacground however; so the tool is hard to see.

The ones I seleted aren't the tools by them selves; instead they have a background or a hand that would make it difficult to know EXACTLY what the tool looks like. The tape measurer has two; so the Al might only identify it if there are two side by side.

If it is able to look past the border; I dont think it would be too difficult to identify the tools. The only ticky thing is how small the images are so I may have hard to tell

The only difficulty would be the excess objects

So I think it would be very difficult for the Al to identify the tools; even if they look past the crosses

Some images were only part of a tool or had other objects in the photo which could make it difficult for AI to identify

In most cases; though; the tools are clear enough (and obvious enough) for the defining features to be easily recognizable.

For other images; they are clear enough that an AI could probably identify it from defining features.

In some cases; there are very few defining features (like the flashlight just being a cylinder)

In other cases; the defining features are blured; and in some there is a lot of things going on in the background; which would make it hard to know what to focus on.
6001,2,1003,Tue Sep 25 12:41:56 2018,Transformed-Images/Splice/,7,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,There is a problem with what to focus on. In some cases; the picture is broken up enough to be kinda hard to identify. Again; there is a problem with seperating the main focus from the background. In other cases; the fact that the tools run parallel to these black lines might make it hard for the AI to know what to look at.
6001,2,1004,Tue Sep 25 12:44:43 2018,Transformed-Images/Frame-Nature/,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,There's a lot of background "noise"; which would make it more difficult to focus. I mostly think that the fact that the pictures are smaller (and more pixelated) would make it more difficult to identify because you lose some of the defining features because of it. In other cases; it could look like too many different objects.
6001,2,1005,Tue Sep 25 12:47:09 2018,Transformed-Images/Original-Tools/,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The complexity of the background; and lack of complete focus on the object might make it more difficult. In the other case; the fact that there is more going on that would detract from the defining features (in this case; the pliars) and make it harder to identify.
6001,2,1006,Tue Sep 25 12:49:07 2018,Transformed-Images/Edge-Tools/,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Again; there is too much background noise going on that could make it harder for an AI to identify the main focus. In the case of the flashlight turned on; it's sort of difficult to see what is in the persons hand. I feel like the main focus for that picture; in this case; would be the hand rather than the tool.

In this example a lot of the objects are easy to identify even though they are shrunken down. They still maintain their shape and the green border has little effect because the images arent inhibitted by the border at all. 
8003,2,1002,Thu Sep 27 13:40:01 2018,Transformed-Images/Edge-Tools/,6,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,It was difficult to identify the images with a lot going on within the interior of the object. The more complex of a surface of the object the more difficult it became because of all the lines and borders. Simple objects with simple surfaces and outlines were easy to identify because their shape is recognizable and the textures were simple.
8003,2,1003,Thu Sep 27 13:43:33 2018,Transformed-Images/Original-Tools/,8,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Some images have a background that doesnt have as high of a contrast as white which could make it more difficult. Some images were too close up which could make it difficult to identify its whole self. Color made it easy to identify the tape measures because not many things are yellow with that kind of shape.
8003,2,1004,Thu Sep 27 13:46:29 2018,Transformed-Images/Shear-Tools/,6,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The images that were difficult to idenfity were because the distortion of the image elongated a few of the images which took away some of their distinguishing factors. For example; a handsaw became difficult because the handle became hard to identify which then made the saw itself hard because im not close enough to see the teeth of the saw. 
8003,2,1005,Thu Sep 27 13:49:35 2018,Transformed-Images/Blur-Tools/,6,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Its easy to identify shapes with a distince color like the tape measure. Its also easy to identify the flashlights when the lens is showing. That is a dead giveaway that the object is a flashlight. The broad side image of a flashlight is difficult because it is a indistinguishable color of black while showing no major distinguished features. It could be recognized as a baton or any other object that looks like a simple tube.
8003,2,1006,Thu Sep 27 13:52:51 2018,Transformed-Images/Splice/,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,It would be difficult determining if the AI was to distinguish between one or two objects in some pictures because the image is broken up in such away that it hints at there being two objects when there is only one. A lot of objects were still easily identifiable because the black X only blocked a small portion of the image and most of the distinguishing factors were still there.

It would be harder to identify the screwdrivers because their simple shape could relate to a large amount of other objects.

8003,1,1003,Thu Sep 27 13:11:55 2018,Transformed-Images/Edge-White-Tools/,6,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Some of the pictures were difficult to identify simple because the image wasnt clear enough to define a distinguishable image. Other objects such as the flashlight will be hard to identify simply because of its shape and how it is similiar to a lot of other objects. Its easy to identify small objects such as the wrenches because they have a distinguished shape on both ends. 
8003,1,1004,Thu Sep 27 13:17:03 2018,Transformed-Images/Resize/,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Even with the decrease in resolution; the scissors are still easily identifiable because of their distinct shape. Other images such as the "bendy" tape measure and pliers became hard to identify because it was too blurry. Objects with unique shapes continued to be recognizable with exception to a wrench that could be mistakes for a simple piece of plastic or metal. The picture of a flashlight that is turned on with a hand holding it has too much going on for it to be easily recognizable at this resolution.

Some objects were too close up and were hard to recognize because there was too much detail. What made this format easier at recognizing objects was there was a defined outline and shape for each object. However; it outlines too much detail on the characterisitics that arent necessary.

Once again there was some close ups that became hard to identify because they kind of blended in with the background. Of those that had enough black to make them a complete image were easy to identify because of their unique shapes.

On top of the distortion; there were a few photos that had watermarks; backgrounds; additional items in the image (Hands; Batteries; Odd Shapes; etc).

The images I selected had weak or bad edge detection or contained objects that were identified that were not the tool/the tool was not visible in the image

The images I selected had additional scene elements that would make it more difficult to pick out the tool within them

Portions of the major shapes of the tools in these images are gone or obfuscated enough that they would be difficult to recognize.

The ones I picked had scene details that could pose a problem for identification. The shovel I chose had a bit of duplicated information from the actual shovel portion that I believe could be misinterpreted

The tools are effectively just scaled inward which shouldn't make it any more difficult to identify.

However; there are still a few objects that might be harder to identify such as the flashlight with the beam because it may be misinterpreted for something like scissors.

There may be a few correct identifications but most likely the AI would have a very hard time identifying these objects because they would have to piece together the tool like a puzzle before even attempting to classify it.

Others would be harder to identify because of thier general shape; for example it might be difficult to identify something that appears like a simple cylinder as a flashlight etc. Other tools may have been misinterpereted by the AI because there were duplicates or because they only saw a portion of the tool instead of the entire object.

It would take away some of the issue with backgroud objects or foreign objects that might disrupt the identification prcoess otherwise.  Some of the objects may still be slightly difficult to identify due to the image only showing a portion of the tool or because of indistinguishable backgrounds.

Some you just can hardly make out all together.  Others there is confusing shading in the background.

The distortion makes the shape nearly impossible to categorize but it is still possible that the AI could recognize some objects based on color and specific features.

They are the only thing that the AI has to parse through in the image. Some of them are still just abnormal objects.

The more difficult ones would be harder to read because they are cut of by the frame of the picture or contain other objects; that would make it hard to categorize as specific tools.

I selected similar ones for being difficult because the picture might be hard to relate to the ones the AI has already seen; or the picture contains something else that would confuse the system.
4003,2,1003,Thu Sep 27 13:10:25 2018,Transformed-Images/Edge-Tools/,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,I still selected similar images; and believe them to be the hardest for an AI to categorize because especially in this contrast the pictures can resemble the outline of other things. Also certain pictures with objects in them further obstruct the view of the tool in this contrast. On the other hand; so pictures would still be extremely simple because even in the contrast the tool resembles tools like it and can be categorize.
4003,2,1004,Thu Sep 27 13:13:01 2018,Transformed-Images/Frame-Nature/,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The pictures I clicked on would still be  difficult because of being covered or having something else in the picture; but most of them would still be very straight forward because the AI is unaffected by the new flowered background.
4003,2,1005,Thu Sep 27 13:15:36 2018,Transformed-Images/Blur-Tools/,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The images provided would still be fairly straight forward for an AI to separate because the blurriness of the photo does not make a difference. The images I selected would pose some challenge because they are either partially covered or they have a smaller refrence frame in which they are not showing the entire object.
4003,2,1006,Thu Sep 27 13:18:02 2018,Transformed-Images/Splice/,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,I don't think the AI could see any of these because the computer can not piece together what is behind the black lines blocking the image of the tool. I selected those specific ten because they were some of the most centered behind the black lines; but I don't think that makes any difference and the AI would struggle on all of the pictures.
4003,1,1001,Thu Sep 27 13:26:27 2018,Transformed-Images/Original-Tools/,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I think all these pictures would easy for an AI to identify because there is nothing obscuring them from view. I selected the images that I did because there is something else in the picture that may make it difficult like a hand or the refrence fram only shows part of a tool.
4003,1,1002,Thu Sep 27 13:30:02 2018,Transformed-Images/Implode-Tools/,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I believe the AI would have a lot of trouble with this because some of the images do not resembel their original selves; but the AI would still categorize many of these if part of the tool is still intact. Ones that I said it would do poorly on I said so because the image is vastly shrunk or different.
4003,1,1003,Thu Sep 27 13:32:43 2018,Transformed-Images/BW-Tools/,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,The AI would find some of these images still very difficult because the image is hardly even there with this contrast set. On the other hand; in the images if there is a concrete outline wiht nothing covering it; then the AI could easily categorize the pictures.
4003,1,1004,Thu Sep 27 13:35:09 2018,Transformed-Images/Resize/,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The idea would do very well at categorizing these images even if they have a different resolution; but some would still be difficult to categorize because with the lower resolution the image appears to be more covered then in previous sections.
4003,1,1005,Thu Sep 27 13:37:15 2018,Transformed-Images/Charcol-Tools/,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The AI would do well at categorizing these because the majority of them have solid outlines and are uncovered even though they have a hollow black and white contrast. Some would still be difficult because of similar reasons as before.
4003,1,1006,Thu Sep 27 13:38:27 2018,Transformed-Images/Edge-White-Tools/,10,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The images would still be fairly easy; but some would be more difficult because their outlined is faded or because they are more covered because of the new contrast.

5007,3,1001,Fri Oct 12 13:06:47 2018,Transformed-Images/Frame-Leaves/,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The arrangement of these images is little bit different than other images so it might be difficult to identify these
5007,3,1002,Fri Oct 12 13:13:10 2018,Transformed-Images/Sketch-Tools/,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,Since the color of these images are black and white; it might be difficult to identify as the black and white tint drops the colors. For example; there is a wrench in that set and it is faded so it gets confusing if it is double headed or single headed wrench 
5007,3,1003,Fri Oct 12 13:16:15 2018,Transformed-Images/Original-Tools/,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The difficult part would be the orientation of the object. For example; there is a torch in that set and its orientation is different than other. This might be the difficult. Easiest part is the colors in these picture. They make it easier to identify the image.
5007,3,1004,Fri Oct 12 13:18:13 2018,Transformed-Images/Rotation/,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,All the images are titled in this set. Since they have colors in them; I think AI would be able to identify these pictures.

Certain identifing features could not be seen. I think the scissors would be easier since you can see the handles. 
6002,1,1002,Wed Sep 26 12:00:59 2018,Transformed-Images/Original-Tools/,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The backgrounds may be distracting for the machine to identify.

The machine may misidentify some because key parts of the objects are missing.
6002,1,1005,Wed Sep 26 12:05:24 2018,Transformed-Images/Resize/,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Most of the tools are easy to identify by their shapes; except for the few with the distracting backgrounds. The backgrounds blend together with the object and you can't tell what it is.
6002,1,1006,Wed Sep 26 12:07:02 2018,Transformed-Images/BW-Tools/,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,Key parts of the tools are missing with this filter; so it looks like many little marks in the squares. There are no identifying features of the objects.
6002,2,1001,Wed Sep 26 11:39:12 2018,Transformed-Images/Splice/,10,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Some of the images aren't like the others; they have distint differences than the others in the set; so the A.I. may only be able to recognize generic-looking tools.

Most of the tools look similar when blurry; unlike when they has the black lines through them.

The tools with black backgrounds would be much easier to identify because there is nothing distracting from the tools. The ones with the different backgrounds have too much going on; and it is difficult to seperate and identify different objects.
6002,2,1004,Wed Sep 26 11:46:54 2018,Transformed-Images/Frame-Nature/,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The border distracts from the objects a bit; but I think A.I. would still be able to distinguish the objects. I picked 90% because of the hand and the flashlight; I believe that would be very difficult fo a machine to identify because the hand is almost completely covering the flashlight.

All others should be quite easy though; because a machine should be able to tell what something is when upside-down or sideways.
